# ETH101---Transfer-Assignment

In this assignment, the withdraw function has to be modified in order to:

1) Make sure that the user can not withdraw more than their balance

2) Correctly adjust the balance of the user after a withdrawal

If someone doesnâ€™t have enough balance for their withdrawal, the function call should throw an error and revert the transaction.:

origtemplate.sol is the original template before modification. 
transferAssignment.sol contains the modified withdraw function.
